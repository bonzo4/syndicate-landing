          Syndicate is a distributed application that runs on the Solana
          network, using uniquely coded smart contracts (each, a “Smart
          Contract” or &quot;NFT&quot;) that allow users to acquire, buy and
          sell, own and transfer, the unique digital assets located at
          daedlaus.io (the “Site”). The visual asset(s) and artwork of each
          individual Syndicate NFT is hereafter known as the &quot;Art&quot;.
          Syndicate LLC (“Syndicate”, “we”, or “us”) is the party making the App
          available for you to use. The Smart Contractunivs and the Site are
          collectively referred to in these T&C as the “App”. Using the App,
          users can view their Syndicate NFT, and use the Smart Contracts to
          acquire Syndicate NFT on the Solana network. The App, its connected
          services, and other options are provided “as is” and “as available”
          without warranty of any kind. There is no ability to undo, change,
          reverse, or restore any transactions on the Solana network. Before
          using the App, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, you must agree to
          these T&C and any other terms and conditions incorporated or
          referenced herein (the T&C and any other terms and conditions
          incorporated or referenced herein are collectively referred to as the
          “Terms”). The purchase of a Syndicate NFT does NOT CONSTITUTE AN
          INVESTMENT.
